# Ranges

NMRium differentiates between peaks and ranges. A range can contain overlapped signals and can be used for assignments. It is possible to define several individual  signals in a group of overlapping lines. Ranges deliver a combination of signal intensity, center of frequency range (in case of multiplets) and coupling analysis. Peaks only define individual lines.
