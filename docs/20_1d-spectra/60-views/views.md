If you have activated the zoom by clicking on the zoom button, you can see both the chemical shift and the intensity of a peak at the bottom of the screen. Move the cursor to a signal and read the two values.

With this function you can determine coupling constants. Press and hold the shift key. Then click on a peak of your multiplet and move the cursor to the second peak. At the bottom of the screen you can read the coupling constant in Hz and ppm.
