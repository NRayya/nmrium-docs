To see all processing steps that were applied, e. g. base line correction or phase correction, click **Filters** in the expandable panel. 

To hide a filter, the corresponding filter must be deactivated. Remove the check mark in the corresponding line. To reactivate the filter, set the check mark again. You can deactivate several filters at the same time by removing several checkmarks at the same time.
