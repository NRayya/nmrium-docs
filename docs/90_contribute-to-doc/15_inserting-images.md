## Insert a link in your .md document

We should put the images in a folder called `img` at the same level as the md document.

```md
![Import file](./img/import_from_file_system.png)
```

In this code `!` indicates that you are inserting an image and that this is not a link. In the square bracket you will add a small image description used for visually impaired persons. Finally in parenthesis you will add the relative path to the image. Because we put all the images in a folder called `img` at the same level of the `md` file the relative path should starts with `./img/`.

Please don't use spaces in the name of the image but only '-'.
