The documentation is present on GitHub and the simplest way to correct or improve the text is to directly edit the file on 'GitHub'.

## Step 1: Install all the requires softwares



If you haven't already, generate a new Docusaurus site using the classic template:

```shell
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-website classic
```

## Step 2: Start your Docusaurus site

Run the development server in the newly created `my-website` folder:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Open `docs/getting-started.md` and edit some lines. The site reloads automatically and display your changes.

## That's it!

Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your Docusaurus project.
